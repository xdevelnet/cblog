I'm often asked if I have any style tips for men.

What does it mean to “upgrade” your style? Does it require a massive wardrobe? Plenty of cash? Drastic changes?

Actually… no!

In fact, when it comes to style tips for men, big things come in small packages. You can level-up your style through simple and easy-to-do tricks while spending LESS – and more WISELY.

In this article I give 10 simple style tips for men that you can use to upgrade your wardrobe and become the best-dressed man in the room.

## 1. Purge Your Closet

Declutter your closet and throw out the “trash”.

My first style tip for men is the simplest: Declutter your closet and throw out the “trash” – as in ANTI-STYLISH clothes that:

•  Are overstretched or worn out
•  Have holes or tears all over
•  Lost their original color
•  Have unwashable stains

This helps you identify the good stuff in your closet to work with. And what types of clothing you might lack. As for the decent-looking clothes you hardly use – put them in a box and write the current date on it.

The idea behind that box is to donate everything that stays in it one year after the marked date. So nothing will remain in your closet as “junk” forever.


## 2. Get Your Clothes Tailored

There's one kind of “trash” that's still worth salvaging – your oversized clothes. Especially casual shirts, jackets or jeans that still look pretty good.

You'll want to take those clothes to a tailor and have them altered. Remember when it comes to your tailor, communication is key to getting the best results.

Get to know your tailor and call them by their name. Make sure you specify your needs for each item. Provide exact measurements or wear the item so they can measure the required adjustment.

You're not just putting in money for their service – you're also putting on the line all that good money you spent on the clothing itself! So do take the whole thing seriously.

## 3. Buy Core Wardrobe Pieces

When you've got a post-purge closet – check if you're lacking certain “core” items of clothing. It might be a pair of dark-colored jeans or casual counterparts of the dress shirt like chambrays or button-downs. Those are examples of ESSENTIAL items you're going to need at some point in any given week.

It's important that you know which pieces make up your “core” wardrobe. They are the building blocks of your personal style. They have to be pretty dependable with great QUALITY. So finding the right brand of basic clothes also matters because your image will be influenced by it.

But how do you choose the BEST “core” clothing? A good strategy here is to build an interchangeable wardrobe. It's the kind of wardrobe where you can mix and match almost anything in terms of color, pattern or texture. If it's successfully built – you'll end up buying much less clothing for years to come.
